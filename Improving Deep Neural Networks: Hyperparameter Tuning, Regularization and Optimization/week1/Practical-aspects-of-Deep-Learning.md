# Train/Dev/Test sets

Choosing the Train/Dev/Test sets for machine learning algorithms can be deciding factor on how you model will perform in practice.
Traditionally people used to devide the Training, Developement and Test sets according to some ratios of total datasets.

One of widely used ratios are 60%, 20%, 20% for Train,Dev and Test respectively, But as the datasets size keeps on increasing exponently, 
20% of data is unnecessary for Test and Dev sets.

for example:
	If the total dataset size is 1M then keeping on 10000 for Dev and 10000 of 10000 for Test set is enough.
